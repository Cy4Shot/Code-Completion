# Subway Mapper

This directory contains a simple program that fetches data from OpenStreetMap, specifically relating to the paths of subway lines on the London Underground. The program then processes to plot this data on a map using matplotlib to generate an geographical map of the London Underground.

For this example, we will be extracting data from the mapper.py script, since it contains the most important code of the program.
